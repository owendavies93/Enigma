Enigma (+networking)
====================

- Encrypts upper case, alphabetic strings using a virtual Enimga machine (circa WWII)
- Send encrypted messages to and recieve from other "enigma machines" using socket libraries, which can be decrypted by the user at the other end provided they are using the same machine configuration (as in WWII)
